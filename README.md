### Tools used
- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- GraphQL
- Cypress (e2e)

### Current functionality
- Edit the translation for each source segment
- Apply search/replace operations on target segments

The aim of this project is to make a fully functional translation editor prototype.

I.e., a piece of software that lets you:
- import files as documents
- translate those documents, with advanced CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) functionality
- export the completed documents as files
